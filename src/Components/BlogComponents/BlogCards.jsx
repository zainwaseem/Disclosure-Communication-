              Cloud Computing 2020: Rising Costs
            </h2>
            <p class="">
              You might remember 2020 for certain other reasons, but it was also
              a landmark year for computing. Barely a decade after the term was
              first used, cloud computing costs rose higher than on-prem
              enterprise data centers. This should have been both old news and
              good news.
